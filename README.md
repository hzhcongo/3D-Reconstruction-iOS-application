# 3D-Reconstruction-iOS-application (Virtuaso)
Virtuaso has an iOS application that is integrated with Virtuaso's web application. <br>
It allows users to take images of objects that they want to process into a 3D model using 3D reconstruction.

Main features:
- Semi-automatic capturing of images based on phone's position. This is done via using the phone's gyroscope
- Configuration of image settings
- Uploading of taken images to web application via POST request to IP address

*The project has been an ongoing one, with the prototype being started off from Tan Jiasheng's Masters thesis.
